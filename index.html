            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Just Creations provides marketing assistance to low-income craftspeople in the developing world. The sale of these products helps to provide a fair wage for the artisans and enables them to pay for food, education, health care, and housing.</p>

            <h2>How is just creations different?</h2>
            <p>Unlike a typical retail store, Just Creations is a not-for-profit organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. An Executive Director manages store operations along with a small team of paid employees. In addition, much of the staffing and support work for Just Creations is accomplished by more than 80 volunteers.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a member of the Fair Trade Federation, Just Creations is committed to promoting the social and economic progress of people in the developing regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Just Creations purchases exclusively from Fair Trade Organizations who work directly with artisans and farmers to ensure that Fair Trade principles are practiced.</p>

            <div class="history">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Just Creations opened its doors for operation in April 1990 as an outgrowth of Covenant Crafts, a store of similar nature whose proprietors were moving on in their ministry.  It was established as an outreach ministry of St. William Catholic Community when they decided it was within their mission as a peacemaking community to keep it going.  They provided some of the initial seed money, volunteers, and Board members to establish Just Creations.
                <br>
                <br>
Since that time, Just Creations, separately incorporated as a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation, has broadened its outreach to churches of all denominations and the Louisville Community in general.  We are proud of our special connection with St. William and continue to nurture that relationship while we invite all people to become a part of the Fair Trade movement.
