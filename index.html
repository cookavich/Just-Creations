            <h2>Welcome to Just Creations!</h1>
            <p>With each visit to our store, discover delightful items from more than 45 countries throughout Asia, Africa and Central and South America, including handcrafted ceramics, jewelry, home d√©cor, musical instruments, baskets and much more.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Just Creations provides marketing assistance to low-income craftspeople in the developing world. The sale of these products helps to provide a fair wage for the artisans and enables them to pay for food, education, health care, and housing.</p>
            <h2>How is just creations different?</h2>
            <p>Unlike a typical retail store, Just Creations is a not-for-profit organization governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. An Executive Director manages store operations along with a small team of paid employees. In addition, much of the staffing and support work for Just Creations is accomplished by more than 80 volunteers.
<br>
<br>
As a member of the Fair Trade Federation, Just Creations is committed to promoting the social and economic progress of people in the developing regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Just Creations purchases exclusively from Fair Trade Organizations who work directly with artisans and farmers to ensure that Fair Trade principles are practiced.</p>
